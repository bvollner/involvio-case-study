# involvio-case-study
A case study of the involvio website as a part of the coursework for MCAD's web development class.
I am not sure how well this will turn out, but fingers crossed that I don't make a fool of myself or open myself up to any legal shenanigans. I picked this website because I am an educator and it popped up when I did a search for well designed education sites... also the colors remind me of mint chocolate chip ice cream, so there... now you know my truest movtivations - dumb luck and food.
